Tank Level Control Scene Description (Factory IO)

This document describes the Factory IO scene used in the Tank Level Control System project, designed to simulate a produced water treatment unit in an oil and gas facility.

Scene Components:

- Tank: Cylindrical, 1000-liter capacity, representing a separator or holding tank.
- Level Sensors:
  - High-level sensor: Triggers at 90% capacity (900 liters).
  - Low-level sensor: Triggers at 10% capacity (100 liters).
- Valves:
  - Inlet valve: Controls water inflow, modulated by PID controller.
  - Outlet valve: Opens for auto or manual draining, triggered by alarms or operator input.
- Pump: Regulates inlet flow, connected to the PID controller output.
- Visualization: 3D view shows tank level, valve states, and alarm indicators.

Setup Notes:

- The tank is initialized empty.
- The PID controller targets a 50% setpoint (500 liters).
- Alarms are visualized with red (high) and yellow (low) indicators.
- Manual override is implemented via a toggle switch in the scene.

See ./media/tank_scene.png for a screenshot of the scene in action.
